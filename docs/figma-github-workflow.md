# Figma Github Workflow

Since Design Tokens are basically a design decisions, the ones that are responsible for taking them should be the Designers.

We are fulfilling this idea by using [Figma Tokens plugin](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/843461159747178978/Figma-Tokens). Thanks to this, Designers are able to maintain token names as well as references and values from the environment that they are most comfortable with.

To store all their work, a plugin's feature called **Github Sync** is used. It allows designers to commit their changes directly to the github repository, straight from the simple Figma Tokens plugin UI.

All Designer's work is kept at the `develop` branch. Merging this branch to master will cause a release of the new version of Design Tokens Library.
